This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Tcl procedure that leads to division by zero under certain conditions. The bug is described in the `bug.tcl` file.  A corrected version of the procedure is provided in the `bugSolution.tcl` file for comparison.  The bug is related to the unexpected behavior of the Tcl interpreter when dealing with expressions in the context of conditional statements.
